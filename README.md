* Electric-field spatial TMS-EEG filtering for individualized time-series estimation of primarily targeted neural assemblies *



Concurrent transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)  with electroencephalography (EEG) is a popular technique,
however, interpreting TMS-EEG results remains challenging due to the no specificity of EEG sources.

We introduce a spatial filtering approach where Electric-field simulations are used as spatial filtering boundaries for subject-individualized data curation.
The method enables individualized source reconstruction of time series arising from the primarily targeted structures employing a customized minimum norm-type estimator.

To validate the present procedure, sensor level analyses was compared to source filtered signals employing TMS evoked potentials. 
Results suggest that the spatial filtering procedure might be efficient enhancing local hidden neuronal dynamics and reducing components emerging from distant topographies.
