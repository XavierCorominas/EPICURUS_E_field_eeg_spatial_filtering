**General Information**

We introduce a spatial filtering approach in which electric field simulations from various non-invasive brain stimulation methods (e.g., transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), transcranial electrical stimulation (tES)) can be used as spatial filtering "boundaries" for subject-specific data processing. EPICURUS method enables individualized source reconstruction of time series originating from the primarily targeted brain regions by employing a customized minimum norm-type estimator, while minimizing signal leakage from distant non-directly stimulated sources.

To validate the approach, a single pulse TMS-EEG experiment was conducted where single TMS pulses were delivered to the left motor cortex (M1). Sensor-level analyses were compared to source-filtered signals using TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs). Results suggest that the spatial filtering procedure effectively enhances local, previously hidden neuronal dynamics while reducing components arising from distant topographies.
